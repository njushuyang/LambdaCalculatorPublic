[The Lambda Calculator](https://lambdacalculator.com)

For Mac and Windows: just [download](https://lambdacalculator.com/#download)
and double-click to start. If you are running OS X 10.7.5 (Mountain Lion) or
later, you may need to temporarily relax your security settings to open the
application, since it is not from the Mac App Store. In System Preferences >
Security & Privacy > General, set "Allow applications downloaded from:" to
"Anywhere". After opening and quitting the app once, you may adjust the
setting as you like. For Linux: start with `java -jar
LambdaCalculator.jar`, but make sure you run it with Sun's Java, not GNU
libgcj.  You can check which version you have with `java -version`.

Windows and Linux users will need to make sure they have the [Java
JRE](http://www.java.com/getjava) 1.6 or newer installed. The Windows version
of the calculator will check on startup if Java is installed, and if
necessary, will take the user to a website where Java can be downloaded.

The teacher edition, in which tree-derivation exercises can be shown in a
presentation mode that automatically computes denotations of nonterminals, is
available upon request to instructors. Please send an email to
