[The Lambda Calculator](http://lambdacalculator.com)

These documents provide some basic exercises to get you started. Just download
any of the files above (or copy and save the text to a blank text file of your
choosing). Then run the Lambda Calculator, select Open from the Menu Bar, and
open the exercise file you saved.

You can also [ [[download a zip of all of the sample exercise files here:

If you are an instructor, email us, and we will be happy to send you more
exercise files. And if you write exercise files yourself, please consider
sending them to us so we can share them here.
