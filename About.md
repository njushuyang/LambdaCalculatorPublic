[The Lambda Calculator](https://lambdacalculator.com)

The Lambda Calculator is an interactive, graphical application to help students
of natural language semantics practice derivations in the typed lambda
calculus. It is designed for both students and teachers, with modules for
online classroom instruction, graded homework assignments, and self-guided
practice. The primary function is to assist in the computation of natural
language denotations up a syntactic tree in the style of Heim & Kratzer's
_Semantics in Generative Grammar_. To this end, the program detects common
errors and attempts to provide intelligent feedback to the student user and a
record of performance for the instructor.
